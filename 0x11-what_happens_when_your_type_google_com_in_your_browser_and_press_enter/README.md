Here, I will try to answer the question "What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter"

This question is a classic and still widely used interview question for many types of software engineering position. It is used to assess a candidateâ€™s general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. One important guideline to begin answering this question is that I should always ask the interviewer whether they would like me to focus in on one specific area of the workflow. For a front-end position it is more of how the DOM is rendering. For an SRE position, it is more of the load balancing mechanism.

This question is a good test of whether a Software Engineer understands DNS.
